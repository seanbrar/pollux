# Reusable workflow for code quality checks
# Called by both CI and release workflows to ensure consistency
# Accepts Python version as input to support version matrix testing
#
# Testing Strategy:
# - Feature branch pushes: Fast tests only (~30s)
# - Draft PRs: Fast tests with DEBUG logging
# - Ready PRs: Progressive + integration + workflows (< 2 min)
# - Main branch: Everything + coverage
