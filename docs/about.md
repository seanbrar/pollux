# About Pollux

## Origins

Pollux began as a Google Summer of Code 2025 project with Google DeepMind. The goal: make multimodal analysis on Gemini efficient, reliable, and accessible.

The project has since evolved beyond its GSoC roots into a production-ready library, but the research-minded approach remains. Every design decision is deliberate. Every abstraction was earned, not assumed.

## Philosophy

**Absorbed complexity.** The library handles source patterns, context caching, rate limiting, and retries so your code doesn't have to. You describe *what* to analyze. Pollux handles *how*.

**Multimodal-native.** PDFs, videos, images, and YouTube URLs are first-class citizens alongside text. Not an afterthought—the core design.

**Production-safe, research-friendly.** Defaults that won't surprise you in production, with escape hatches for experimentation.

## The Name

Pollux is the brightest star in the Gemini constellation.

The library's job is to clear away infrastructure complexity so Gemini's capabilities reach your code cleanly. You focus on the interesting parts—the questions you want to ask, the content you want to analyze. The plumbing fades into the background.
