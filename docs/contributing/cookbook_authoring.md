# Cookbook Authoring Guide

Write problem-first, copy-pasteable recipes that help users succeed quickly while showcasing best practices of `pollux`.

## Goals

- Show real scenarios users face, not features in isolation.
- Provide runnable code with clear inputs/outputs and expected success checks.
- Teach progressively: starter -> research workflows -> production patterns.

## Structure a Recipe

Start each recipe with a short, specific problem statement and a quick summary of what the reader will achieve.

Template:

```python
"""Recipe: [Descriptive Problem Statement]

When you need to: [One sentence describing the scenario]

Ingredients:
- [Prereqs: API key, data, deps]

What you'll learn:
- [Key concept 1]
- [Key concept 2]

Difficulty: 1-5   Time: ~N minutes
"""

from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any

from pydantic import BaseModel

from pollux import create_executor, types


class OutputSchema(BaseModel):
    ...


def main() -> None:
    # 1) Setup & prerequisites
    # 2) Quick version (copy-paste)
    # 3) Custom version (show flexibility)
    # 4) Print/validate results
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Checklist:

- Imports included, types clear, minimal dependencies.
- Explain why key choices are made (not what lines do).
- Show a success check (e.g., assert shape, print metrics).
- Avoid secrets or private data in examples; use repo fixtures where possible.

## Progressive Levels

- Starter (getting-started/): one core concept, minimal setup, copy-paste ready.
- Research workflows: multi-step processing, structured outputs, multi-source synthesis.
- Production patterns: retries, telemetry, caching, adapters, and error handling.

## Writing Style

- Lead with the problem: "When you need to ...".
- Keep code concise and idiomatic (Python 3.13, type hints).
- Prefer clear names and small functions; add comments for rationale.
- Show both quick and customizable paths when useful.

## Quality Bar

- Actionable: runnable end-to-end with clear expected output.
- Verifiable: includes checks so success is provable.
- Safe: redact secrets, call out cost/tier notes when relevant.
- Connected: link to related how-tos, concepts, and reference APIs.

## Where Examples Live

- Code examples live under `cookbook/` in the repo, organized by scenario
  (e.g., `getting-started/`, `research-workflows/`, `production/`).
- This guide complements the repository cookbook index:
  `cookbook/README.md`.

## Running & Testing Recipes

- Use the module runner - no PYTHONPATH needed:
  - `python -m cookbook --list` to discover available recipes
  - `python -m cookbook <spec> -- [recipe args]` to run a recipe
  - Spec can be path (`getting-started/analyze-single-paper.py`) or dotted (`production.resume_on_failure`)
- The runner defaults to executing from the repository root. Opt out if needed with `--no-cwd-repo-root`.
- Pass all script flags after `--` so they reach your recipe unchanged.
- Keep recipes self-contained: avoid relying on ambient CWD; print clear success checks.
